abstract = {A new three-dimensional (3-D) acoustic image formation technique is proposed that is based on the transmission of wide bandwidth pulse signals and the application of the 3-D fast Fourier transform. A solution to the Helmholz wave equation has been obtained using the Born approximation. The solution contains analytical expressions for the spatial spectra of the transmit and receive radiation patterns for transducers of various geometries with lenses of fixed focal distances. It has been shown that the proposed algorithms allow for radiation patterns with constant widths at depths both behind and in front of the focal point, starting practically from the plane of the transducer. The theoretical and experimental investigations and computer simulation for both spherical and rectangular transducer shapes have been performed. The results were used to estimate the beamwidths and the side lobe levels. A variant of the linear array has been studied for cylindrical lens of a fixed focal distance moving in a lateral direction. It has been shown that, in this case, a high resolution (of the order of a few wavelengths) can be achieved along all three Cartesian coordinates at a very high scanning velocity. The influence of the moving scatterers' velocity in inhomogeneous medium on the spatial radiation pattern characteristics has been estimated.},

abstract = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in R-m (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n = O(m(1/4) log(5/2)(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an l(p), ball for O < p <= 1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with l(2) error O(N1/2-1/p). It is possible to design n = O (N log (m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of l(p) balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0 < p <= 1, and give a criterion identifying near-optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces.},

abstract = {Small-diameter cylindrical imaging platforms, such as those being considered in the development of in vivo ultrasonic microprobes, pose unique image formation challenges. The curved apertures they provide are incompatible with many of the commonly used frequency-domain synthetic aperture imaging algorithms. At the same time, their frequently small diameters place limits on the available aperture and the angular resolution that may be achieved. We obtain a three-dimensional, frequency-domain imaging algorithm for this geometry by making suitable approximations to the point spread function for wave propagation in cylindrical coordinates and obtaining its Fourier transform by analogy with the equivalent problem in Cartesian coordinates. For the most effective use of aperture, we propose using a focused transducer to place a virtual source a short distance from the probe. The focus is treated as a diverging source by the imaging algorithm, which then forms images on deeper cylindrical shells. This approach retains the simplicity and potential angular resolution of a single element, yet permits full use of the available probe aperture and a higher energy output. Computer simulations and experimental results using wire targets show that this imaging technique attains the resolution limit dictated by the operating wavelength and the transducer characteristics.},

diffraction spreading than conventional focused beams, physically, it is
a superposition of plane waves having the same wavelength, but traveling

can provide more uniform lateral beamwidth and smoother on-axis field
magnitude over a greater depth of field than the rectangular transducers
and Gaussian apodized transmitters which have been used to increase the
limited depth of field of conventional focused beams. Compared with
currently developed limited diffraction beams which must be generated by
2-D array transducers, the beam has a wider lateral beamwidth but with
lower sidelobe levels. In ultrasonic medical imaging, the beam enables
one to obtain a line focus using a 1-D array transducer and to eliminate
the diffraction correction required in some applications such as tissue
characterization},

abstract = {A new 2D (two-dimensional) and 3D (three-dimensional) pulse-echo imaging method (Fourier method) has been developed with limited diffraction beams. In this method, a plane wave pulse (broadband) is used to transmit and limited diffraction beams of different parameters are used to receive. Signals received are processed to obtain spatial Fourier transform of object functions and images are constructed with an inverse Fourier transform. Because only one transmission is required to construct images, this method may achieve a high frame rate (up to 3750 frames/s for biological soft tissues at a depth of 200 mm). To demonstrate the efficacy of the method, both 2D C-mode and 3D images have been simulated using conditions that are typical for medical ultrasound. Results show that images of high resolutions (about 6 wavelengths at 200 mm) and low sidelobes (around -60 dB) can be constructed over a large depth of interest (30 to 200 mm) with a 50 mm diameter aperture. Experiments with the new method have also been carried out. 2D B-mode images have been constructed with conventional linear arrays. In the experiment, an ATS 539 tissue-equivalent phantom and two linear arrays were used. The first array had a center frequency of 2.25 MHz, dimension of 18.288 mm\&amp;times;\&amp;times;12.192 mm, and 48 elements. The second had a center frequency of 2.5 MHz, 38.4 mm\&amp;times;10 mm in dimension, and 64 elements. Images of different fields of views were constructed from RF data acquired with these arrays using both the new and conventional dynamic focusing (delay-and-sum) methods. Results show that qualities of images constructed are almost identical with the two methods in terms of sidelobes, contrast, and lateral and axial resolutions. Phase aberration has also been assessed for the two methods, and results show that its influence is about the same on both methods. In addition, a practical imaging system to implement the new method is suggested and potential applications of the method are discussed},

abstract = {The emergence of ultrafast frame rates in ultrasonic imaging has been recently made possible by the development of new imaging modalities such as transient elastography. Data acquisition rates reaching more than thousands of images per second enable the real-time visualization of shear mechanical waves propagating in biological tissues, which convey information about local viscoelastic properties of tissues. The first proposed approach for reaching such ultrafast frame rates consists of transmitting plane waves into the medium. However, because the beamforming process is then restricted to the receive mode, the echographic images obtained in the ultrafast mode suffer from a low quality in terms of resolution and contrast and affect the robustness of the transient elastography mode. It is here proposed to improve the beamforming process by using a coherent recombination of compounded plane-wave transmissions to recover high-quality echographic images without degrading the high frame rate capabilities. A theoretical model is derived for the comparison between the proposed method and the conventional B-mode imaging in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution. Our model predicts that a significantly smaller number of insonifications, 10 times lower, is sufficient to reach an image quality comparable to conventional B-mode. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by in vitro experiments performed in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Such results raise the appeal of coherent compounds for use with standard imaging modes such as B-mode or color flow. Moreover, in the context of transient elastography, ultrafast frame rates can be preserved while increasing the image quality compared with flat insonifications. Improvements on the transient elastography mode are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The problem of reconstructing the reflectivity of a three-dimensional medium with density and compressibility variations is examined. For the special case of continuous-wave (CW) insonification, exact inversion formulas have recently been reported for recovering an unknown scattering parameter from scattering measurements. In this work, exact solutions, or inversion formulas, are obtained for the general case of arbitrary broad-band insonification where the incident wave is assumed to be a spherically diverging broad-bandwidth pulse of arbitrary shape. Solutions are derived under the assumption that the scattering is sufficiently weak for the Born approximation to hold. Exact inversion formulas are obtained for three aperture geometries: a plane, cylindrical, or spherical recording surface enclosing the scattering region. Under most practical conditions, the process of back projection and coherent summation over spherical surfaces in image space, without prior filtering, is shown to provide a close approximation to the exact inversion procedure. Finally, in the case of the spherical geometry, the mathematical equivalence between the three-dimensional inverse Radon transform and the far-field approximation to the exact solution is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Noninvasive ultrafast imaging of intrinsic waves such as electromechanical waves or remotely induced shear waves in elastography imaging techniques for human cardiac applications remains challenging. In this paper, we propose ultrafast imaging of the heart with adapted sector size by coherently compounding diverging waves emitted from a standard transthoracic cardiac phased-array probe. As in ultrafast imaging with plane wave coherent compounding, diverging waves can be summed coherently to obtain high-quality images of the entire heart at high frame rate in a full field of view. To image the propagation of shear waves with a large SNR, the field of view can be adapted by changing the angular aperture of the transmitted wave. Backscattered echoes from successive circular wave acquisitions are coherently summed at every location in the image to improve the image quality while maintaining very high frame rates. The transmitted diverging waves, angular apertures, and subaperture sizes were tested in simulation, and ultrafast coherent compounding was implemented in a commercial scanner. The improvement of the imaging quality was quantified in phantoms and in one human heart, in vivo. Imaging shear wave propagation at 2500 frames/s using 5 diverging waves provided a large increase of the SNR of the tissue velocity estimates while maintaining a high frame rate. Finally, ultrafast imaging with 1 to 5 diverging waves was used to image the human heart at a frame rate of 4500 to 900 frames/s over an entire cardiac cycle. Spatial coherent compounding provided a strong improvement of the imaging quality, even with a small number of transmitted diverging waves and a high frame rate, which allows imaging of the propagation of electromechanical and shear waves with good image quality.},

abstract = {The author presents a system model and inversion for the beam-steered data obtained by linearly varying the relative phase among the elements of an array, also known as phased array scan data. The system model and inversion incorporate the radiation pattern of the array's elements. The inversion method utilizes the time samples of the echoed signals for each scan angle instead of range focusing. It is shown that the temporal Fourier transform of the phased array scan data provides the distribution of the spatial Fourier transform of the reflectivity function for the medium to be imaged. The extent of this coverage is related to the array's length and the temporal frequency bandwidth of the transmitted pulsed signal. Sampling constraints and reconstruction procedure for the imaging system are discussed. It is shown that the imaging information obtained by the inversion of phased array scan data is equivalent to the image reconstructed from its synthesized array counterpart.},

@article{Soumekh_TIP_1999,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with an echo imaging system which utilizes focused beams of an aperture along a specific contour, for example, a line or a circular arc, in both the transmit and receive modes for data collection. Such data collection strategies are useful for imaging internal structures of a target which are located at a certain depth relative to the aperture; unfocused echo signature of an interior structure possesses a low signal-to-clutter/noise power ratio, and is not desirable. The conventional methods for depth-focused echo imaging use transmit/receive focusing on a set of prescribed points in the spatial domain (that is, a two-dimensional grid); this is exceedingly time-consuming though it does not require any postprocessing of the measured data. The proposed scheme of depth-focusing along a contour requires a significantly smaller time period for data acquisition, and relies on a relatively fast Fourier-based method for image formation. This Fourier-based method is shown to be applicable in near-field as well as far-field imaging scenarios, and does not put any restrictions on the size of the aperture, the size of the target area, and the frequency of radiation. The approach is applicable in depth-focused imaging with a mechanically rotating focused aperture, or a phased array. Results are provided.},

abstract = {Assessment of the performance of medical ultrasound equipment is generally based on the image quality in fundamental mode. Recent development of the so-called tissue harmonic imaging (THI) mode induces the need for assessment of differences in the quality of imaging in THI vs. fundamental imaging mode. Quality features to be tested are sensitivity (penetration depth), spatial resolution, contrast resolution, lesion signal-to-noise ratio, and tissue-to-clutter ratio (TCR). These features are explained and examples are shown. The main conclusion from a comparison of the results for the two imaging modes might be that when using THI improvement of TCR, in particular in the near field, is obtained at the expense of a loss in axial resolution. Furthermore, lesion detection is not significantly improved. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

60\&amp;deg;. Results show that a uniform -6 dB lateral resolution of 1\&amp;deg;

resolution was about 4.5\&amp;deg; and the side lobe level of the

abstract = {An ultrasound synthetic aperture imaging method based on a
monostatic approach was studied experimentally. The proposed synthetic
aperture method offers good dynamical resolution along with fast
numerical reconstruction. In this study complex object data were
recorded coherently in a two-dimensional hologram using a 3.5 MHz single
transducer with a fairly wide-angle beam. Image reconstruction which
applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field
curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer
using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient
use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning
scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be
made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by
evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a
typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range
resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100
mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the
beam width was made narrower. Although it resulted in a slightly reduced
spatial resolution this compromise has to be done for better resolution
of low-contrast targets such as cysts. The study showed that cysts as
small as 2 mm by diameter could be resolved},
